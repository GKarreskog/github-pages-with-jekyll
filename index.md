# About me

I'm Ph.D. candidate in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics goin on the academic job market 2020/2021. My research interest are centered on learning in games and bounded rationality. In particular, I seek to understand and model how people make decisions, how they adjust to incentives, and how the behavior of populations evolve.
